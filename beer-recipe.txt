Using soft water, begin the infusion mash with 4 gallons (15.1 liters) of brewing liquor and rest at 145°F (63°C). Stir in 3 g gypsum and rest for 20 minutes. Add 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of boiling liquor to step the mash up to 155°F (68°C). Rest for 40 minutes.

Take first runnings, and add 0.5 ounces (14 g) of whole-cone Hallertau Blanc hops as first wort hops (FWH). Batch sparge with 4.5 gallons (17 L) of 170°F (77°C) liquor, adding 2 g calcium chloride.

Boil for 90 minutes, adding whole-cone Hallertau Blanc as listed in the hop bill. Whirlpool for 5 minutes after flameout, and run off wort into fermenter.

Cool the wort to 65°F (18°C), then rehydrate an 11 g packet of Safale US-05 in warm water for 15 minutes and pitch. Add about 10 ppm of pure oxygen to the wort.

Ferment to completion (6 to 8 days) and keg. Dry hop with 1 ounce (28 g) of Hallertau Blanc for three days at 60°F (16°C), then transfer beer to a clean keg. Force carbonate and enjoy!
